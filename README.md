# GetterDone

An open source ToDo application created by Matt Ward.
[http://getterdone.mwdesigns.com](http://getterdone.mwdesigns.com "live demo")

# Purpose

The purpose of this app is to serve as a demo for my OpenSource PHP MVC framework.
The source code is to be extensively documented to allow for adaptation of the underlying framework.
This example application will illustrate the basic functionality of the framework and should serve as a usage guide.

# Road Map

* Basic pages (homepage and about)
* Register and login pages (using HTTPS)
* A simple AJAX enabled task manager
* Adding a mobile site

# Feedback / Feature Requests

If you would like to give feedback or request a feature be implemented, you may email
[getterdone@mwdesigns.com](mailto:getterdone@mwdesigns.com "email me") or you are welcome to implement the feature yourself. I would love
to be notified if you think you added something useful, but of course you are not obligated to do so.
